route-reflector.tcl
	AS 100 has two clusters; the first consists of routers: 2,3,4,5, 
	where 2 and 3 are configured as route reflectors. The second 
	cluster is composed of routers 6 (Route Reflector), 7 and 8. 
	Router 1 is not part of any of the two clusters. Special 
	configuration is necessary only for the RR's. For each of the three 
	RR's we configure its clients. Also, it's necessary to specify a 
	cluster-id for routers 2 and 3 that are RR's for the same cluster. 
	Finally, each router is statically configured with a /24 prefix 
	(route-reflector.tcl). For details look at the configuration files.

To run the simulation:
	ns route-reflector.tcl 	[ -stop simulation_time_in_sec [ default 100 ] ]    
				[ -dir  path_to_dir_that_contains_configuration_file [ default cwd ] ]
