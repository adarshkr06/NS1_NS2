ex1.tcl:
	Assume routers BGP1 (AS1) and BGP2 (AS2); BGP2 advertises three networks:
	10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24 and 10.0.3.0/24. Router BGP1 does not accept 
	advertisements for network 10.0.1.0/24 by AS2. To accomplish this, a route 
	map is applied on the inbound updates received by BGP1. At some point after
	the beginning of the simulation we change the applied policies and accept 
	all announcements from router 2.

To run the simulation:
	ns ex1.tcl 	[ -stop simulation_time_in_sec [ default 100 ] ]    
			[ -dir  path_to_dir_that_contains_configuration_file [ default cwd ] ]
