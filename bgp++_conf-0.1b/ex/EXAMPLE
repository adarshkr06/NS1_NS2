This directory contains a simple example for using bgp++_conf.

The router.info file defines the following 8 AS topology:

  BGP-level and ns-2-level topology:

  a <--> b is a peering relationship between 'a' and 'b'
  a ---> b is a customer-provider relationship between 'a' (provider) and 'b'
           (customer)
  a --&> b is a customer-provider relationship between 'a' (provider) and 'b'
           (customer) where a provides full routes to b
  a ---- b is an ibgp relationship between 'a' and 'b'

The routerprefs.info file associates a \24 prefix with each AS.
The additional.info file enables fsm logging at routers 1e1 1e2 and 1e3

The .tcl and .conf files are generated with the command:

bgp++_conf -f router.info -F routerprefs.info -b additional.info -L 5 
	-L 2 -T "10 100" -d "4 0.4.104.0/24 100" > ns.tcl
	
The -L option turns on logging of UPDATE and KEEPALIVE msgs
The -T option makes the routers dump their routing tables at 
the 10th and 100th sec of  the simulation.
The -d option instructs router 4 to withdraw prefi 0.4.104.0/24
at the 100th sec of the simulation.

Assuming that the .conf files are located in the ./conf directory, the simulation
is run as follows:

ns ns.tcl -dir ./conf/ -check 50 1 120

(Look the info page for more on the -check option)
