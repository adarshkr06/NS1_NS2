ex2.tcl:
	In this configuration, router BGP2 uses a prefix-list to accept all updates for 
	networks with prefix mask length less or equal to 19, while it denies all other 
	updates with longer prefix masks. At the 50th second of the simulation we reconfigure 
	the prefix list so as to accept prefixes with mask length greater equal to 18
	
To run the simulation:
	ns ex2.tcl 	[ -stop simulation_time_in_sec [ default 100 ] ]    
			[ -dir  path_to_dir_that_contains_configuration_file [ default cwd ] ]
