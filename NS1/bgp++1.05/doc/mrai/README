This directory contains examples that test 
BGP++ mrai implementation. All the experiments use 
the following topology. Also, all the experiments 
test how router 2 behaves in its session with 
router 1, when it receives advertisements from 
routers 3,4 and 5.

for PER PREFIX MRAI:
-------------------

******mrai-1.tcl: 

at 20 router 3 advertises to 2 that it can reach perfix p, at 3 as-hop distance  
at 21 router 4 advertises to 2 that it can reach perfix p, at 2 as-hop distance

the experiment is successful if router 2 suppresses the advertisement of the second
UPDATE to router 1 for MRAI seconds.  

Also the same experiment is repeated using two different prefixes p1 and p2. In this 
scenario the UPDATES should propagate immediately to router 1 through router 2 without 
any suppressing.


******mrai-2.tcl: 

at 20 router 3 advertises to 2 that it can reach prefix p, at 3 as-hop distance  
at 21 router 4 advertises to 2 that it can reach prefix p, at 2 as-hop distance
at 22 router 5 advertises to 2 that it originates prefix p

the experiment is successful if router 2 suppresses the advertisement of routers 
4 and 5 for MRAI time. Furthermore, the latter advertisement overwrites the first,
thus at the end of MRAI interval only the UPDATE of router 5 is propagated.

Also the same experiment is repeated using three different prefixes p1, p2 and p3. In this 
scenario the UPDATES should propagate immediately to router 1 through router 2 without 
any suppressing.

 
******mrai-3.tcl: 

at 20 router 3 advertises to 2 that it can reach prefix p, at 3 as-hop distance  
at 25 router 3 withdraws its advertisement. 

the experiment is successful if router 2 propagates the withdrawal for prefix p 
immediately. 


PER PEER MRAI

******mrai-4.tcl: 

at 20 router 3 advertises to 2 that it can reach prefix p1, at 3 as-hops distance  
at 21 router 4 advertises to 2 that it can reach prefix p2, at 2 as-hops distance

the experiment is successful if router 2 suppresses the advertisement of the second
UPDATE to router 1 for MRAI seconds.  


******mrai-5.tcl: 

at 20 router 3 advertises to 2 that it can reach prefix p, at 3 as-hops distance  
at 25 router 3 withdraws its advertisement. 

the experiment is successful if router 2 propagates the withdrawal for prefix p 
immediately. 


******mrai-6.tcl: 

at 20 router 3 advertises to 2 that it can reach prefix p, at 3 as-hops distance  
at 21 router 4 advertises to 2 that it can reach prefix p, at 2 as-hops distance
at 22 router 5 advertises to 2 that it originates prefix p

the experiment is successful if router 2 suppresses the advertisement of routers 
4 and 5 for MRAI time. Furthermore, the later advertisement overwrites the first,
thus at the end of MRAI interval only the UPDATE of router 5 is propagated.
