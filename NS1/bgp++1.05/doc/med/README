This scenario illustrates how med influences the 
BGP decision algorithm. The following topology is used:

	       100---400
                 |\   
                 | \  
                 |  \       
              300a---300b


The scenario is taken from Cisco BGP case studies webpage 
that you can find at:
	http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/459/bgp-toc.html

Routers 400, 300a, and 300b advertise the same prefix p to router 100,
with different MED values, 120, 200, and 50 respectively. 
We start router 400 at the 200th second of the simulation. This way,
router 100 establishes a connection with routers 300a and 300b 
before connecting to 400. Router 100 pics router 300a to reach 
the prefix, since this router has a lower med than 300b. Also 
router 400 is another alternative but it is not chosen because
paths that are learned first are preferred (this is done to minimize
routing flaps).

If we repeat the simulation using the command "bgp always-compare-med" 
at router 100, then router 100 will choose 400 to reach p. This command 
will enable comparing MEDs for all paths and not only for
paths with the same first AS. To run the experiments:

	ns med.tcl -dir ./conf -stop 300 
and:
	ns med.tcl -dir ./conf -stop 300 -cmpmed 
to enable "bgp always-compare-med"
